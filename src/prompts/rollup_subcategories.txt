You will be provided with a detailed list of subcategory names that are related to ServiceNow
incidents.  This list is too specific and needs to be generalized.

You have discretion in how many items will be in the generalized list but do not include more 
than 12 items.

The list of subcategories will be a comma delimited list.

You must respond in JSON in the following form:
[
    {category: "generalized category name", subcategories: [subcategory1, subcategory2, ...]}
]
where the object has a key for each "subcategory" whose value is "category".

Example:
Input: "Memory Pressure", "Compute Pressure", "Server Down"
Output:
[
    {
        category: "System Resources",
        subcategories: ["Memory Pressure", "Compute Pressure"]
    },
    {
        category: "Unplanned Outage",
        subcategories: ["Server Down"]
    }
]
